# 3D Models for female pin headers

All credits are for [https://grabcad.com/library/arduino-female-pin-header-for-kicad-1](https://grabcad.com/library/arduino-female-pin-header-for-kicad-1).


I just created this github repository because I am unable to find the author's github page, and I want to keep this in my kicad collection.
So if you have any information related to these models, let me know and update the repository.
